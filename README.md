# TensorFlow Image Classification With TF_Flowers Dataset

We are going to load TF_Flowers dataset and predict flowers name from ['dandelion', 'daisy', 'tulips', 'sunflowers', 'roses'] this array which means this are our class names

We will also use the pre trained model and predict the which flower it is!
